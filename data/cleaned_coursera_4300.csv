the myths of ancient greece and rome as a way of exploring the nature of myth and the function it plays for individuals societies and nations we will also pay some attention to the way the greeks and

the delphic oracle we watch as he eventually realizes the horror of what he has done with odysseus we saw how a great hero can re build his identity after struggles while oedipus shows us how our identities can dissolve before our very eyes the myth of oedipus is one of transgressionsintentional and unintentionaland about the limits of human knowledge in euripides bacchae the identity of gods and mortals is under scrutiny here dionysus the god of wine and of tragedy and also madness appears as a character on stage through the dissolution of pentheus we see the terrible consequences that

remade moving ahead several centuries we jump into a different part of the mediterranean to let the romans give us their take on myth although many poets tried to rewrite homer for their own times no one succeeded quite like vergil his epic poem the aeneid chronicles a powerful re building of a culture that both identifies with and defines itself against previously told myths in contrast to the

Process Mining: Data science in Action,Eindhoven University of Technology,4.7,https://www.coursera.org/learn/process-mining,intermediate level,0,process mining is the missing link between model based process analysis and data oriented analysis techniques through concrete data sets and easy to use software the course provides data science knowledge that can be applied directly to analyze and improve processes in a variety of domains data science is the profession of the future because organizations that are unable to use big data in a smart way will not survive it is not sufficient to focus on data storage and data analysis the data scientist also needs to relate data to process analysis process mining bridges the gap between traditional model based process analysis e g simulation and other business process management techniques and data centric analysis techniques such as machine learning and data mining process mining seeks the confrontation between event data i e observed behavior and process models hand made or discovered automatically this technology has become available only recently but it can be applied to any type of operational processes organizations and systems example applications include analyzing treatment processes in hospitals improving customer service processes in a multinational understanding the browsing behavior of customers using booking site analyzing failures of a baggage handling system and improving the user interface of an x ray machine all of these applications have in common that dynamic behavior needs to be related to process models hence we refer to this as data science in action the course explains the key analysis techniques in process mining participants will learn various process discovery algorithms these can be used to automatically learn process models from raw event data various other process analysis techniques that use event data will be presented moreover the course will provide easy to use software real life data sets and practical skills to directly apply the theory in a variety of application domains this course starts with an overview of approaches and technologies that use event data to support decision making and business process re design then the course focuses on process mining as a bridge between data mining and business process modeling the course is at an introductory level with various practical assignments the course covers the three main types of process mining 1 the first type of process mining is discovery a discovery technique takes an event log and produces a process model without using any a priori information an example is the alpha algorithm that takes an event log and produces a process model a petri net explaining the behavior recorded in the log 2 the second type of process mining is conformance here an existing process model is compared with an event log of the same process conformance checking can be used to check if reality as recorded in the log conforms to the model and vice versa 3 the third type of process mining is enhancement here the idea is to extend or improve an existing process model using information about the actual process recorded in some event log whereas conformance checking measures the alignment between model and reality this third type of process mining aims at changing or extending the a priori model an example is the extension of a process model with performance information e g showing bottlenecks process mining techniques can be used in an offline but also online setting the latter is known as operational support an example is the detection of non conformance at the moment the deviation actually takes place another example is time prediction for running cases i e given a partially executed case the remaining processing time is estimated based on historic information of similar cases process mining provides not only a bridge between data mining and business process management it also helps to address the classical divide between business and it evidence based business process management based on process mining helps to create a common ground for business process improvement and information systems development the course uses many examples using real life event logs to illustrate the concepts and algorithms after taking this course one is able to run process mining projects and have a good understanding of the business process intelligence field after taking this course you should have a good understanding of business process intelligence techniques in particular process mining understand the role of big data in today s society be able to relate process mining techniques to other analysis techniques such as simulation business intelligence data mining machine learning and verification be able to apply basic process discovery techniques to learn a process model from an event log both manually and using tools be able to apply basic conformance checking techniques to compare event logs and process models both manually and using tools be able to extend a process model with information extracted from the event log e g show bottlenecks have a good understanding of the data needed to start a process mining project be able to characterize the questions that can be answered based on such event data explain how process mining can also be used for operational support prediction and recommendation and be able to conduct process mining projects in a structured manner so much research has been done in bpm domain this course gives a solid foundation in bpm to anyone who wishes to pursue a career in this domain great course professor wil van der aalst delivers great lectures very clear and deep in general with good examples i really enjoyed the course from

Emergent Phenomena in Science and Everyday Life,"University of California, Irvine",4.4,https://www.coursera.org/learn/emergent-phenomena,beginner level,3800,before the advent of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century most scientists believed that it should be possible to predict the behavior of any object in the universe simply by understanding the behavior of its constituent parts for instance if one could write down the equations of motion for every atom in a system it should be possible to solve those equations with the aid of a sufficiently large computing device and make accurate predictions about that system s future however there are some systems that defy this notion consider a living cell which consists mostly of carbon hydrogen and oxygen along with other trace elements we can study these components individually without ever imagining how combining them in just the right way can lead to something as complex and wonderful as a living organism thus we can consider life to be an emergent property of what is essentially an accumulation of constituent parts that are somehow organized in a very precise way this course lets you explore the concept of emergence using examples from materials science mathematics biology physics and neuroscience to illustrate how ordinary components when brought together can collectively yield unexpected surprising behaviors note the fractal image sierpinkski triangle depicted on the course home page was generated by a software application called xaos 3 4 which is distributed by the free software foundation under a gnu general public license upon completing this course you will be able to 1 explain the difference in assumptions between an emergent versus reductive approach to science 2 explain why the reductivist approach is understood by many to be inadequate as a means of describing and predicting complex systems 3 describe how the length scale used to examine a phenomenon can contribute to how you analyze and understand it 4 explain why the search for general principles that explain emergent phenomena make them an active locus of scientific investigation 5 discuss examples of emergent phenomena and explain why they are classified as emergent wonderful course great faculty and insightful learnings a very good course in introducing advanced concepts in a simple way and have performed the spirit of multidisciplinary research very well i can read about this but i ll give it 5 stars because they deliver it nicely,"['Computational Thinking', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Physics', 'Biology', 'Systems Thinking', 'Psychology', 'Mathematical Modeling', 'Analysis', 'Scientific Methods', 'General Science and Research']",3.0,7.666666666666667,Physical Science and Engineering,english,1,14750.0
